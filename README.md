# Anomaly Detection Autoencoder - electrocardiogram dataset 

Using errors to detect anomalies in time series data.

Training a model to come up with a representation of 784 bytes into 32 bytes that when it reconstructs from those 32 bytes, it will reconstruct with a relatively low loss

Goal: we want the autoencoder to fail
