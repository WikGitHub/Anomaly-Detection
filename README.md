## Anomaly Detection Autoencoder - Electrocardiogram Dataset 

# STILL IN PROGRESS

The Anomaly Detector Autoencoder is a machine learning model used to detect anomalies in ECG data. It utilises an autoencoder architecture consisting of an encoder and a decoder.

## Requirements
To use the Anomaly Detector Autoencoder, you need the following dependencies:

- TensorFlow (version 2.13.0rc0)
- NumPy (version 1.24.3)
- Matplotlib (version 3.7.1)
- Scikit-learn (version 1.2.2)


## Conclusion
The Anomaly Detector Autoencoder provides a tool for detecting anomalies in ECG data. By leveraging an autoencoder architecture, it can learn representations of normal ECG patterns and identify deviations from these patterns. With proper data preprocessing and model training, it can be used to improve anomaly detection and contribute to the field of healthcare.
